### Implement
[] update the 2 buttons (expense list and expense graphs) so that one shows that its a active btn
[] update the form to be a controlled form
[] error handle when the user doesn't fill out everything in the form
[] convert the time generated by the db to normal human readable date/time
[] create a landing page component
[] take the data and learn how to display a pie chart, and maybe a line graph?

### Test
[] test error handling when a user didn't fill out all the fields in the form
[] test that the route that is suppose to go to the landing page works
[] test when a user clicks submit after filling out all the fields in the form that a new row appears in the expense table (stub?)
[] test that clicking the Expense List and Expense Graphs btn takes you to the correct place
[x] test login
[] test logout
[] test register


### Questions
- should the expense table only list expenses for the current month?
- should All Expenses tab in NavBar should a list of all expenses ever inputed?
- should there be a date picker to let you filter through past months of expenses?
- should there be a filter to only show category?
- filter for highest to lowest and vice versa?
